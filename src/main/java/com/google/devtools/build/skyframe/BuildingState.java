 * its entry acquires a new {@code BuildingState} object, which persists until it is done again.
 *
 * <p>This class should be considered a private inner class of {@link NodeEntry} -- no other
 * classes should instantiate a {@code BuildingState} object or call any of its methods directly.
 * It is in a separate file solely to keep the {@link NodeEntry} class readable. In particular, the
 * caller must synchronize access to this class.

   * must start the evaluation of this node, while any subsequent callers must not.
